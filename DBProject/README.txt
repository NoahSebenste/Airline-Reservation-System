Instructions:
In order to run my project, you need to install the webserver called xampp. You can download it from
this link:

https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

Make sure to install it to the C drive, this should be the default. Once installed, copy the DBProject folder
into the htdocs folder located inside xampp. It will look like C:\xampp\htdocs\DBProject

Finally, launch the xampp control panel and start the apache server, then in chrome 
navigate to lhost/DBProject/index.php

Now you should be at the homepage of my website and can start looking at my project from there. If you
can't get it working or have any questions feel free to email me. I will repsond quickly. This 
project was built using php,hmtl,css,javascript, and SQL. Thanks!
